	<h2>My swimming career</h2>
	<il>
		<li> I started swimming competitively when I was 9, in junior black. 
Near the end of that year I made my first qualification meet, LC regionals.</li>
		<li>In my second year I was put into Age Group Green, were I made my first 
provincial time. The next year I stayed in the same group but worked harder in practice
suddenly COVID hit. </li>
		<li>The next year and a half we were online. 
Recently as the COVID restriction got lowered we were allowed to swim again.</li>
		<li>I was put into the provincial group, and now I have made my first 3 junior provincal times.
Very recently I have been training with the NKB national team, and I was invited to train 
during March Break.</li>
